 * A class for client-server connections with a threaded server.
 * The echo server creates a server socket. Once a client arrives, a new
 * thread is created to service all client requests for the connection.
 * The example includes a java client and a C# client. If C# weren't involved,
 * the server and client could use a bufferedreader, which allows readln to be
 * used, and printwriter, which allows println to be used. These avoid
 * playing with byte arrays and encodings. See the Java Tutorial for an
 * example using buffered reader and printwriter.
