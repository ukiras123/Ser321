<H1>Help for Folder Browser</H1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select a Folder</b>. Select a folder and enter it as a command-line
  argument:<br>
  <b>java -cp classes ser321.FolderBrowser aFolderPath</b><br>
  If you don't enter an argument, then the Browser assumes the current working
  directory.</li>
  <li><b>Browser another Folder</b>. Enter an absolute or relative path to
  another folder in the text field at the top of the browser. Then click
  the button to rebuild the tree. Since the program builds the entire tree,
  its probably best to not select a folder with lots of files and
  sub-directories.</li>
  <li><b>Select Files</b>. Expand sub-trees and select terminal nodes. When
  you select a file with one of these file types, its contents are displayed
  in the right panel: <b>txt, java, cpp, hpp, html, xml</b>.</li>
</ul>
